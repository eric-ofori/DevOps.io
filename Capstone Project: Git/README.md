# Capstone Project Enhancing a Community Library Website

## Background Scenario ##

You're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the **_"Greenwood Community Library"_**. The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: **_Home, About Us, Events and Contact Us_**. Your team decides to add a **"Book Reviews"** section and update the **"Events"** page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: **"Morgan"** and **"Jamie"**. Morgan will focus on adding the **_"Book Reviews"_** section, while Jamie will update the **_"Events"_** page with new community events.
